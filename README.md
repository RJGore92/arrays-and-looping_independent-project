#### By **Robert James "Jimmy" Gore**

## Description

The primary purpose of this site is to establish a basic portfolio-quality program and site under the guidelines established by Epicodus's end-of-unit project for Arrays and Looping, utilizing various tools and functionality introduced through Epicodus Intro to Programming Unit Two in addition to assets and skills learned from units one and two.  It acts as a comprehensive review of all elements and units taught during the first three units of Epicodus's tracks.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Install Git Bash for Git repository cloning of the project
* Install Atom for review and edit of Code
* To access repository for project and review code, first clone repository at the appropriate link, then use Git Bash and/or Atom to open the project folder.
* GitHub Pages link is RJGore92.github.io/arrays-and-looping_independent-project

## Known Bugs

No known bugs are present in this project.

## Assignment Specs

1. The project starts out by requesting an input string.  This string has no limit in how long it can be, but requires at least a single character within it to convert to a puzzle (requires the input field to not be empty).
2. The project then converts the string into an aray, and using a nested for loop and an array variable of vowels, determines which characters in the string are vowels, soon removing them and replacing a hyphen "-" in their position.  Vowels are tracked in uppercase and lowercase.
3. Once the array string has been completely converted to a puzzle, the program then rejoins the text and outputs it into the HTML as the encrypted puzzle.

####  Inputs and outputs (examples):

* Input: "test this", output: "t-st th-s".
* Input: "Hello, my name is Jimmy.", output: "H-ll-, my n-m- -s J-mmy."
