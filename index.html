          <h1>Beep Boop!</h1>
          <p>With this project, titled <strong>Beep-Boop!</strong>, I intend to demonstrate some measures of behavior-driven development utilizing arrays, looping, and all skills learned up to this point in Epicodus units 1-3.</p>
          <p>What will happen with this project's behaviors are listed in the readme, but I will also list the general specs out here and behaviors based strictly on a number-type input.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The general behavior specs are as follows.  Priority of behaviors is listed from lowest priority to highest (lowest is 1, highest is 3).</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Numbers that contain a zero at any point will be replaced completely with <em>"Beep!"</em>.</li>
          <li>Numbers that contain a one at any point override the first behavior, replacing the number completely with <em>"Boop!"</em> instead.</li>
          <li>Numbers that are divisible by three override the first two behaviors, replacing them completely with <em>"I'm sorry, Dave.  I'm afraid I can't do that."</em>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If any of the numbers in the range up to the input do not meet any of the three criteria, they are returned in the array as their original numeric value.</p>
        <p>Below are forms of examples for outputs between certain number ranges. Note that the expected results start utilizing the number zero and proceed to the user's input number as a stop point.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Numbers up to an input of 10 starting from zero: "Beep", "Boop", 2, "I'm sorry, Dave.  I'm afraid I can't do that.", 4, 5, "I'm sorry, Dave...", 7, 8, "I'm sorry, Dave...", "Boop"</li>
          <li>Numbers starting from 11 and up to 20: "Boop", "I'm sorry, Dave...", "Boop", "Boop", "I'm sorry, Dave...", "Boop", "Boop", "I'm sorry, Dave", "Boop", "Beep"</li>
          <li>Numbers starting from 21 and up to 30: "I'm sorry, Dave...", 22, 23, "I'm sorry, Dave...", 25, 26, "I'm sorry, Dave...", 28, 29, "I'm sorry, Dave..."</li>
        </ul>

          <img class="float-left img-one" src="./img/20181128_141724-2.jpg" alt="Image of Robert James Gore">
          <p>Robert James Gore has been a programmer since his sophomore year of high school, originally starting with Java and building experience with a space invaders game during the second half of high school.  Since then, Robert has been programming on and off, but has found other projects to build with various codes and experiments.</p>
          <p>Now, Robert studies at Epicodus through the Fidgetech program extension, coding mainly on his own to build web pages with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, having started under this school in September, 2018.</p>
          <p>Samples of Robert's work are available <a href="https://github.com/RJGore92?tab=repositories">here</a>  </p>

          <h1>More details about the program:</h1>
          <p>Beyond the specs listed in the prior slide, this section details further behaviors and limitations and provides more clarification about the program that you are about to interact with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Once the program is reached on the next slide, the user will be prompted to enter a number.  This input slot is required for the program to run and will not accept values that are not numbers (i.e. text), nor will it accept numbers less than zero.  Blank input fields, non-number inputs, and negative number inputs will result in the program requesting for a proper input with numeric value of zero or greater.</li>
            <li>Should a valid numeric input be found, the program creates an array of numbers starting at zero, incrementing by one, and proceeding to expand the array until the target number is reached.</li>
            <li>The program will then proceed to change numbers based on the specs above, highest priority changes first before working to change the numbers to the lower priority specs.  Details about this are listed on the previous slide.  If the user needs examples, click <button type="button" id="revert-back" onclick="onClickOne()">here</button> to go back.</li>
            <li>The array, once changed by the program scripts to where all specs are met within it, will be displayed in a visible list, and the user input form will be temporarily hidden unless the user wishes to input another number or reset the form for the next person.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>When the user is ready, click <button type="button" id="proceed-to-program" onclick="onClickTwo()">this button</button> to begin.</p>
